!! MVC Frameworks

* [[Backbone.js|http://backbonejs.org]] - Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, and views with declarative event handling. It connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.
* [[Ember.js|http://emberjs.com]] - Ember makes Handlebars templates even better by ensuring your HTML stays up-to-date when the underlying model changes. To get started, you don't even need to write any JavaScript.
* [[Angular.js|https://angularjs.org]] - AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

!! Templates

* [[Handlebars.js|http://handlebarsjs.com]] - Handlebars provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration. Mustache templates are compatible with Handlebars, so you can take a Mustache template, import it into Handlebars, and start taking advantage of the extra Handlebars features.
* [[Mustache.js|http://mustache.github.io]] (less built-out than Handlebars) - Mustache is a simple web template system with implementations available for ActionScript, C++, Clojure, CoffeeScript, ColdFusion, D, Erlang, Fantom, Go, Java, JavaScript, Lua, .NET, Objective-C, Pharo, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala and XQuery.
* [[Jade|http://jade-lang.com]] - Jade is a node template engine designed primarily for server-side templating in node.js.
* [[Haml-js|https://github.com/creationix/haml-js]] - Haml-js allows the Haml syntax to be used in a JavaScript project. It has most of the same functionality as the original Haml.
* [[Eco|https://github.com/sstephenson/eco]] - Eco lets you embed CoffeeScript logic in your markup.

!! Testing

* [[Casper.js|http://casperjs.org]] - CasperJS is a navigation scripting and testing utility for [[PhantomJS|http://phantomjs.org]] and [[SlimerJS|http://www.slimerjs.org]] written in Javascript.
* [[Zombie.js|http://zombie.js.org]] - Zombie.js is a lightweight framework for testing client-side JavaScript code in a simulated environment. No browser required.
