* ''PK'' Primary Key
* ''NN'' Not Null
* ''BIN'' Binary (stores data as binary strings. There is no character set so sorting and comparison is based on the numeric values of the bytes in the values.)
* ''UN'' Unsigned (non-negative numbers only. so if the range is -500 to 500, instead its 0 - 1000, the range is the same but it starts at 0)
* ''UQ'' Create/remove Unique Key
* ''ZF'' Zero-Filled (if the length is 5 like INT(5) then every field is filled with 0â€™s to the 5th value. 12 = 00012, 400 = 00400, etc. )
* ''AI'' Auto Increment
