* defining & ordering browsing navigation steps
* filling & submitting forms
* clicking & following links
* capturing screenshots of a page (or part of it)
* testing remote DOM
* logging events
* downloading resources, including binary ones
* writing functional test suites, saving results as JUnit XML
